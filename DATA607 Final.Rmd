<span style="color: cornflowerblue;font-size:25px;">Policy on Collaboration</span>

You may work in a team of up to three people. Each project team member is responsible for understanding and being able to explain all of the submitted project code. Remember that you can take work that you find elsewhere as a base to build on, but you need to acknowledge the source, so that I base your grade on what you contributed, not on what you started with!

<span style="color: cornflowerblue;font-size:25px;">Approval Meeting</span>

Once you’ve turned in your one paragraph proposal, I want to schedule a 15 minute phone meeting with each person or team
(starting when we return from Thanksgiving break), where you’ll describe the reason (benefit) for doing this work and/or
question you’re seeking to answer, where you’ll source the data, and the overall flow. For team projects, I also want you to
articulate the roles and responsibilities of each team member.

<span style="color: cornflowerblue;font-size:25px;">Final Project Checklist</span>

To receive full credit, you’ll need to deliver on all of the items in the checklist below. Please read carefully through this checklist
before you make your project proposal. You are (within these checklist constraints) strongly urged to limit scope and make the
necessary simplifying assumptions so that you can deliver your work on time!

## Scope

![](Article.png)
With COVID-19 impacting employment worldwide, many articles have been published highlighting the toll it has taken on specific demographics. Our motivation to dive deeper into the impact by demographic, has been influenced by articles such as [**COVID-19 has spurred America’s first female recession**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/COVID-19-has-spurred-americas-first-female-recession). This article talk about the negative affect the pandemic has had on women in the United States. Using data from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/), we hope to identify if the impact was disproportionate or great to women vs. men.

## Data Preparation {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Load Data

In order to conduct our studies we used data from [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/tables.htm#empstat) specifically data regarding:

* [Table 9 : *Unemployed persons by occupation, sex, and age*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat09.htm)
* [Table 10: *Unemployed persons by occupation, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and sex*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat10.htm)
* [Table 30: *Unemployed persons by occupation and sex*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat30.htm)


<!------- * [Table 34: *Unemployed jobseekers by sex, reason for unemployment, and active jobsearch methods used*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat34.htm) --------->

The data was **<span style="color:blue">web scraped </span>** then encapsulated using the functions `as.dataframe()`, `html_table()` and `read_html`, then subsetted. 

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
url_9  <- "https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea09.htm"
url_10 <- "https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea10.htm"
url_30 <- "https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea30.htm"

```

  reactable(highlight = TRUE, pagination = TRUE, height = 850)
```

### Transform Data

Data manipulation and *tidying* for `Table 9` included:

* relabeling column values to reflect a *(4 digit: year)* **-** *(2 digit: month)* (`%y%m`) format.
* subsetting data frames to remove unnecessary data or blank rows with the help of piping `%>%`
* categorizing data with a `Gender` column, that included a `Male`,`Female` and `Total` value respectively.

  **Note:** Total value was used to specify data that reflects total unemployment counts.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", results='hide'}
colnames(df_tb10) <- c("Label","2020-03", "2020-04",
                         "2020-05", "2020-06", "2020-07",
                         "2020-08", "2020-09", "2020-10",
                         "2020-11", "2020-12","2021-01",
                         "2021-02", "2021-03")
                              

colnames(df_tb9) <- c("Label", "2020-03", "2020-04",
                         "2020-05", "2020-06", "2020-07",
                         "2020-08", "2020-09", "2020-10",
                         "2020-11", "2020-12","2021-01",
                         "2021-02", "2021-03")
```

```{r}
df_tb9_tdy<-
    as.data.frame(df_tb9[1,]%>%
      assign_in(list(1,1),"Month")%>%
        bind_rows(df_tb9[3:14,],
          df_tb9[16:27,],
          df_tb9[29:40,])
    )
# Adding male and female category
df_tb9_tdy$Gender<-"Total"
df_tb9_tdy$Gender[14:25] <- "Male"
df_tb9_tdy$Gender[26:37] <- "Female"
```

And repeated for `Table 10`.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
df_tb10_tdy<-
    as.data.frame(df_tb10[1,]%>%
      assign_in(list(1,1),"Month")%>%
        bind_rows(df_tb10[3:14,],
          df_tb10[16:27,],
          df_tb10[29:40,])
    )

# Adding male and female category
df_tb10_tdy$Gender<-"Total"
df_tb10_tdy$Gender[14:25] <- "Male"
df_tb10_tdy$Gender[26:37] <- "Female"
```

This *tidy* data (`df_tb9_tdy`,`df_tb10_tdy`) is the baseline used for our evaluation of the comparison between unemployment rates of men and women, during the beginning month until present day, of the pandemic. 

Using [**ZevRoss: Know Your Data | Easy multi-panel plots in R using facet_wrap() and facet_grid() from ggplot2**](http://zevross.com/blog/2019/04/02/easy-multi-panel-plots-in-r-using-facet_wrap-and-facet_grid-from-ggplot2/) as a point of reference, we continue to transform the data.\newline

Specifically:

* `regex` is used within the `gsub()` function, to remove `,` from our `Rate` column.
* `Month` and `Rate` is then transformed to data types that will allow for further analysis.


```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
#Dependency on df_tb10_tdy    Rate, Gender, Age Group
df_tb10_ln <- as.data.frame(df_tb10_tdy %>% 
  slice(c(16,17,19,22,23,24,25,28,29,31,34,35,36,37)) %>% 
    gather("Month_Year", "Rate", 2:14)%>%
      lapply(function(x){ 
        gsub(",", "", x)}))
```

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
df_tb10_ln$Month_Year<- as.yearmon(df_tb10_ln$Month_Year) 
df_tb10_ln$Rate <- as.numeric(df_tb10_ln$Rate)
```

The data is stored to `df_tb10_ln`. When sorted, it is easy to see that the highest unemployment rates overall, did occur among women between the ages of *16 to 19*, during the months of *March and April of 2020*, by a small margin over men `18 to 19` in `March & April 2020`.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
head(df_tb10_ln[with(df_tb10_ln, order(-Rate)),])%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_classic("striped", full_width = F)
```

From here we calculate rates and store the values to `df_tb9_rt`. The data is transformed in a month over month format, so that it can be assessed as a trend throughout the year. The functions used to create this data frame included:

* piping `%>%`
* `slice()`
* `gather()`
* `mutate()`

This data frame is grouped by `Gender` specifically.

Dates and counts are converted with `as.yearmon()` & `as.numeric()`.

The calculations for our month-over-month (`MoM`) values and month-over-month rates (`MoM_Rates`) were as follows:

$MoM= \frac{Count - lag(Count)}{lag(Count)}$ 
$MoM\_Rate =MoM\times100 :rounded\ to\ the\ tenth$ 

where [`lag()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lag) is a time series shift from the `stats` package.


```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
# Month over Month employment rate change by gender 
#Dependency on df_tb9_tdy:     Rate and Gender
df_tb9_rt <- df_tb9_tdy %>% 
  slice(c(14,26)) %>% 
    gather("Month_Year", "Count", 2:14)

df_tb9_rt$Month_Year<- as.yearmon(df_tb9_rt$Month_Year)
df_tb9_rt$Count <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",df_tb9_rt$Count))

df_tb9_rt <- 
    df_tb9_rt %>% 
      group_by(Gender) %>% 
        mutate(MoM = (Count - lag(Count)) / lag(Count)) %>% 
          mutate(MoM_Rate =  round(MoM * 100, 2))
```

The result is a data frame with rates for ages *16 and over* (or all age groups).

```{r, echo= FALSE,class.source = "fold-hide", results='show'}
head(df_tb9_rt[with(df_tb9_rt, order(- MoM_Rate)),])%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_classic("striped", full_width = F)
```

Following a similar approach, but grouping by `Gender` & `Label` we create data frame `df_tb9_MoM` and can see the impact for each age bracket.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
# Month over Month employment rate change by age and gender 
#Dependency on df_tb9_tdy:     Count, age, and Gender

df_tb9_MoM <- df_tb9_tdy %>% 
  slice(c(16,17,19,22,23,24,25,28,29,31,34,35,36,37)) %>% 
  gather("Month_Year", "Count", 2:14)

df_tb9_MoM$Month_Year<- as.yearmon(df_tb9_MoM$Month_Year) 
df_tb9_MoM$Count <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",df_tb9_MoM$Count))

df_tb9_MoM <- df_tb9_MoM %>% 
  group_by(Gender, Label) %>% 
  mutate(MoM = (Count - lag(Count)) / lag(Count)) %>% 
  mutate(MoM_Rate =  round(MoM * 100, 1))
```

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", echo= FALSE, results='show'}
arrange(df_tb9_MoM,Label)[15:25,]%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
    kable_classic("striped", full_width = F)
```

Finally for our linear trend analysis `df_tb10_trend` is created for an additional perspective of unemployment by demographic by year.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
#Dependency on df_tb10_tdy:     Rate and Gender
#data transformation operation: from wide to long function: gather, package: tidyr  
df_tb10_trend <- df_tb10_tdy %>% 
  slice(c(14,26)) %>% 
  gather("Month_Year", "Rate", 2:14)

#data transformation operation: date format function: as.yearmon, package: zoo  
df_tb10_trend$Month_Year<- as.yearmon(df_tb10_trend$Month_Year) 
df_tb10_trend$Rate <- as.numeric(df_tb10_trend$Rate)
```

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", echo= FALSE, results='show'}
head(df_tb10_trend,5)%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
    kable_classic("striped", full_width = F)
```

Because the format of table 30 was slightly different from the latter, information it was *tidied* using the same overview but accounting for the specific rows and columns we required.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", message=FALSE}
df_tb30 <- 
  as.data.frame(
    bind_rows(df_tb30[3,]
              ,df_tb30[5:33,])%>%
      select(-2,-3)%>%
                lapply(function(x){
                   gsub(" occupations", "", x)}
                        ))%>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Occupation_Label",
                 "Total_Unemployed_Rates_April_2020",
    "Total_Unemployed_Rates_April_2021", "Men_Unemployment_Rate_2020",
    "Men_Unemployment_Rate_2021", "Women_Unemployment_Rate_2020",
    "Women_Unemployment_Rate_2021"))
```

Industries are categorized as primary industry categories and sub categories in the original `HTML` file shown below

![](industry categories.png){width=50%}
<br>

therefore 2 data frames were made with the [`gather()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/1.1.3/topics/gather) function from the `tidyr` package. 

* `df_tb30_full` : noting all main and sub industry names
* `df_tb30_sub`  : noting only the primary categories
* `df_tb30_rc`   : including rate change

`Gender_Year` column is created in the transformation with rate being transformed into a single column. 

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
# All categories
df_tb30_full<-as.data.frame(df_tb30 %>% 
  select(-2,-3)%>%
    slice(c(2:30)) %>%
      gather("Gender_Year", "Rate", 2:5))%>%
        mutate(Rate = as.numeric(Rate))
# Only Primary categories
df_tb30_sub<-as.data.frame(df_tb30 %>% 
  select(-2,-3)%>%
    slice(c(3,6,15,21,24,28)) %>%
      gather("Gender_Year", "Rate", 2:5))%>%
        mutate(Rate = as.numeric(Rate))
```

An if else statement is used, referencing `Gender_Year` to categorize gender in our results.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
df_tb30_full$Gender<-
  ifelse(grepl("Men", df_tb30_full$Gender_Year), "Male",
               ifelse(grepl("Women", df_tb30_full$Gender_Year), "Female", ""))

df_tb30_sub$Gender<-
  ifelse(grepl("Men", df_tb30_sub$Gender_Year), "Male",
         ifelse(grepl("Women", df_tb30_sub$Gender_Year), "Female", ""))
```

The `Year` column is added to `df_tb30_sub` using case_when() and [endsWith()](https://www.marsja.se/r-add-column-to-dataframe-based-on-other-columns-conditions-dplyr/)

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
df_tb30_sub <- 
  df_tb30_sub %>%
  mutate(Year = case_when(
    endsWith(Gender_Year, "2020") ~ "2020",
    endsWith(Gender_Year, "2021") ~ "2021"))
```

In order to create `Rate_Change` in `df_tb30_rc` we used the following calculation in `mutate()`:

$\frac{2021-2020}{2020} \times 100$

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
df_tb30_rc<-
  df_tb30_sub %>%
    select(- 2) %>% 
      spread(Year,Rate)

df_tb30_rc<-df_tb30_rc%>%
  mutate(Rate_Change =
    round((((df_tb30_rc$'2021' - df_tb30_rc$'2020')/df_tb30_rc$'2020')*100),2))

```

The resulting data frames are as follows:

**df_tb30_full**

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", echo = FALSE}
head(df_tb30_full,10)%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
    kable_classic("striped", full_width = F)
```

**df_tb30_sub**

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", echo = FALSE}
head(df_tb30_sub,10)%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
    kable_classic("striped", full_width = F)
```

**df_tb30_rc**

```{r echo = FALSE}
df_tb30_rc%>%
  kbl()%>%
    kable_classic("striped", full_width = F)
```


### Exploratory Data Analysis

The data from `Unemployment by Occupation and Gender`seems to support that women were more significantly impacted by unemployment in 2020, than men in virtually all industries.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
ggplot(df_tb30_full, aes(x=fct_reorder(factor(Occupation_Label),Rate), y = (Rate),color = Gender,
                         group = Gender, fill=Gender)) +
  geom_col(position="dodge") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text( hjust=1))+
  labs(title = 'Unemployment by Occupation and Gender'
       ,subtitle = "4/2020-4/2021",
       x = "Occupation", y = "Rate")+
  coord_flip()
```


However when running `summary()` on our data, we see an low [`R-squared`](https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit#:~:text=R%2Dsquared%20is%20a%20statistical,multiple%20determination%20for%20multiple%20regression.&text=100%25%20indicates%20that%20the%20model,response%20data%20around%20its%20mean.) value of `0.0118`. This indicates that our data does not fit well in our regression model. 

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
#testing linear model. issue: gender is categorical var- need to look into this
# only accounts for 1.18% of data, Multiple R-squared:  0.0118
summary(lm(Count~Gender, df_tb9_rt))
```

This fact is supported when running `plot()`, which results in various charts that we cannot used to support whether a relationship between unemployment and gender exists.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
plot(lm(Count~Gender, df_tb9_rt))
```

## Analysis{.tabset .tabset-pills}

Based on the the data seen in the below, women experienced a substantial loss in employment from the months of March to August 2020. This coincides with the [first day of stay at home order in the United States.](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/lockdown-day-1)

### Gender & Age {.tabset .tabset-pills}

#### Overall 

We see that both male and females saw their largest unemployment spike in early March, women consistently having a higher rate monthly until about September 2020.

**df_tb10_trend**
```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
ggplot(df_tb10_trend, aes(x=factor(Month_Year), y = (Rate),color = Gender,
                          group = Gender, fill=Gender)) +
  geom_col(position="dodge") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))+
  labs(title = 'Unemployment Rates by Gender'
       ,subtitle = "03/2020-03/2021",
       x = "Month", y = "Rate")
```


Additionally, when broken down into age groups, we can see `18 to 19 years`, `16 to 17 years` and `35 to 44 years` of age where the highest for women and far exceeded the rates for men in the early months.

**df_tb10_ln**
```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
(ggplot(data = df_tb10_ln, aes(Month_Year,Rate,color = Gender,group = Gender))+
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))+
  labs(title = 'Unemployment Rates by Age Group and Gender'
       ,subtitle = "03/2020-03/2021",
       x = "Month", y = "Rate")+
  facet_wrap( ~ Label, scales = "free_y"))
```

#### Month-over-month

Grouping and plotting our data by month, allows us to see the trend from March 2020 to March 2021. Doing so paints a clearer picture of the impact by demographic of COVID.

**df_tb9_rt**

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df_tb9_rt, aes(x=factor(Month_Year), y=MoM, fill=Gender)) + 
  geom_col(position="dodge") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+  
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))+
  labs(title = 'Month over Month Employment Rate Change by Gender'
       ,subtitle = "03/2020-03/2021",
       x = "Month", y = "Rate Chnage")
```

**df_tb9_MoM**

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", warning=FALSE}
##bar plot month over month age grp and geneder
(ggplot(df_tb9_MoM, aes(x=factor(Month_Year), y = (MoM), color = Gender,
                        group = Gender, fill=Gender)) +
  geom_col(position="dodge") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, hjust=1))+
  labs(title= 'Month over Month Employment Rate Change by Age Group and Gender',
       subtitle="03/2020-03/2021",
       x="Month", y="Rate Change")+
  facet_wrap( ~ Label, scales = "free_y"))
```

### Gender & Occupation

When the data is stratified by industry, we see the trend holds true regardless of profession.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", fig.height=10, fig.width=12}
(ggplot(data = df_tb30_sub, aes(Year, Rate, color = Gender,
                                group = Gender, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_col(position="dodge") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))+
  labs(title = 'Plot 1: Unemployment Rates by Occupation and Gender'
       ,subtitle = "2020-2021",
       x = "Year", y = "Rate")+
  facet_wrap( ~ Occupation_Label, scales = "free_y",
              ncol = 3,labeller = labeller(Service = "Gender_Year")))
```


```{r class.source = "fold-hide", warning=FALSE}
##bar plot month over month age group and gender
ggplot(df_tb30_rc, aes(x=factor(Occupation_Label), y = (Rate_Change), color = Gender,
                        group = Gender, fill=Gender)) +
  geom_col(position="dodge") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust=1))+
  labs(title= 'Rate Change Per Industry',
       subtitle="04/2020-04/2021",
       x="Industry", y="Rate Change")+coord_flip()
```

## Conclusion

Our results support the title for the the article which inspired us, since it was published August 5,2020. At this point in the pandemic women were losing or leaving their jobs at a alarming rate. The concerns raised at the time were valid, and was at least 1 month away from producing data to supported the contrary. However, with the pandemic coming to a close (hopefully), we believe the trend should lean more favorably in women returning to the workforce.
